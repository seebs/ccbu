# Computers Can Be Understood

Placeholder for some thoughts, writing, and exercises about the idea that
you can understand computers and that you can sometimes do coding and
debugging better by thinking about them than by experimenting without a
mental model.

Directories have a README. Please read the README first, and do not read
other files too quickly -- you might spoil the puzzles!
